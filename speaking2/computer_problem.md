# Describe a time when you had a problem with using the computer

I'd like to share my difficulty encountered while transitioning to Linux - computer OS.

- university requirement
- differ form Windows (infrastructure design -> user interface)
  - TUI - GUI. Ex: create file
  - computer compatible. Ex: Apps suddenly don't run
- Small users poll: app support
- mainly in professional purpose -> lack the curiosity -> hindrance

Alt: necessary skill -> job opportune, salary
